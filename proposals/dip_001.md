# Dual Mining Proposal

##### the purpose of this proposal is to replace Zilliqa with Dogether when Zilliqa stoping support for POW.
    we need to ensure that our machines can dual mining
# Notice
    this is just a proposal, it does not mean it will be implemented in the end. 
    it may take repeated revision and passd the voting to implemented.
### Implementation Details
	an whole cycle is 60 minutes â‰ˆ 200 blocks
    80% of the rewards will be allocated to 40 blocks in each cycle
    so every 160 blocks mined,network will switch to high reward mode
```python
def getBlockRewards(blockNum):
    cycleSize = 200  # the whole cycle size
    low = 160  # 80% blocks is low rewards
    if blockNum % cycleSize > low:
        return 32000 # high reward
    else:
        return 8000 #low reward
```


### if Proposal Passed
|| low reward phase  | high reward phase |
| :-----| ----: | :----: |
| Rewards | 8000 | 32000 |
    if you only mine dogether, you will not be affected at all.
    if you switch to dogether mining at suitable time, you will get 80% dogether compared to only mining dogether.

### Potential Risks
	too slow block gen rate in the low phase
    amplifying the duration of the low phase
    unstable network cause reorg
